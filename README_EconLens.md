# EconLens

EconLens is a data analytics project that explores the relationship between stock market trends and key macroeconomic indicators in the U.S. economy. Using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries, the project aggregates and cleans data on unemployment, CPI, and stock prices (AAPL, TSLA, JPM, PLD, AMZN) from 1999 to 2024.

The project extracts insights like the impact of unemployment on stock performance, historical patterns in market volatility, and seasonal trends in returns. We use correlation coefficients, linear regression, and grouped means to draw meaningful conclusions backed by visualizations.

### Key Features
- Merges cleaned datasets from Alpha Vantage, government CPI sources, and OECD unemployment records.
- Produces visuals like dual-axis line plots, bar graphs, and scatterplots for macro-trend analysis.
- Identifies historical patterns across sectors and interprets economic phenomena like COVID-19 impact and the 2008 financial crisis.
